          Ecological problems and lack of resources can lead to the extinction

            Mars is the fourth largest planet from the Sun and the seventh
            largest planet in the solar system. The mass of the planet is 10.7%
            of the mass of the Earth. Named after the ancient Roman god of war,
            Mars.

            The popular idea that Mars is inhabit by intelligent marsians spread
            widely at the end of the 19th century. Numerous observations and
            announcements by famous people have generated the so-called "Martian
            fever" around this topic.

          <p>
            In 1899, while studying atmospheric radio noise using receivers at
            the Colorado Observatory, inventor Nikola Tesla observed a repeating
            signal. He speculated that it could be a radio signal from other
            planets, such as Mars.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a 1901 interview, Tesla said that interference could be cause
            artificially. He could not decipher them, but considered it
            impossible that they arose by chance. In his opinion, it was a
            greeting from one planet to another.
